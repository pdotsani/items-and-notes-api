1732750723600:post-treatment-plan "The arm is a crucial part of the human body, and the bicep muscle plays a significant role in its functionality. However, when one experiences severe pain in the arm, it can hinder daily activities and limit mobility. This discomfort may indicate underlying issues such as muscle strain, injury, or other medical conditions that require attention. Addressing the pain promptly is essential for maintaining overall arm health and restoring strength and flexibility to the bicep."
